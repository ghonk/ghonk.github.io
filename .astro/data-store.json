Note: this is before any parameter tuning, choosing some sensible defaults (e.g., the `adam` optimizer, unit dropout) and setting the input to character-by-character. \n\nThe biggest concern with LSTM on this project was that the data were simply too small to build a generative representation. No intermediate step produced good rules---steps only differed in their quality of identical replication of the character sequence. The choice of input as 100 character blocks might be increasing this identical text replication pattern. On the other hand, word-by-word prediction will produce an even smaller set of patterns. Stay tuned for the next iteration where a word-by-word LSTM will be examined.","src/content/blog/2017-12-20-roa-lstm.md","e61efef2f1cc404f",{"html":80,"metadata":81},"\u003Ch3 id=\"this-post-presents-an-evolving-attempt-to-generate-novel-ferengi-rules-of-acquisition-with-classic-and-contemporary-approaches-to-natural-language-processing\">This post presents an \u003Cem>evolving\u003C/em> attempt to generate novel Ferengi Rules of Acquisition with classic and contemporary approaches to natural language processing.\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/assets/imgs/roa.jpg\" alt=\"timely\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"the-ferengi-are-a-species-of-uber-capitalists-with-a-1950s-mentality-re-social-issues-that-exist-in-the-star-trek-universe-the-rules-of-acquisition-are-one-part-governmental-charter-one-part-values-system-theyre-written-as-proverbs-so-theyre-naturally-short-and-there-arent-a-ton-of-them-138-in-the-comprehensive-star-trek-universe-in-their-own-words\">The Ferengi are a species of uber-capitalists with a 1950’s mentality re: social issues that exist in the Star Trek Universe.

This includes functions to set up the *state* information of a model and quickly take rectangular data and format it for the `catlearn` design pattern---the stateful list processor.\n\n# getting Started\n\nIf you haven't already done so, download the `catlearn` and `catlearn.suppls` packages.\n\n\n{% highlight r %}\ninstall.packages(c(\"devtools\", \"catlearn\"))\ndevtools::install_github(\"ghonk/catlearn.suppls\")\n{% endhighlight %}\n\n# choosing some data and setting up the model\n\nWe're going to use the classic `iris` dataset and DIVA (the DIVergent Autoencoder) for this demonstration. We need two objects to run a model in `catlearn`, the model's `state` and the training matrix, which we will call `tr`.\n\n\n{% highlight r %}\n# # # load the libraries\nlibrary(catlearn)\nlibrary(catlearn.suppls)\n{% endhighlight %}\n\n*First, we will construct the model's state.* For this demonstration we'll set the hyper-parameters to values that we know---a priori---will play nice with our dataset. For real-world problems, you will likely want optimize these values (see future post on grid search and Bayesian optimization options with `catlearn.suppls`). Detailed description of model hyper-parameters is available in the normal places (e.g., `?slpDIVA`).\n\n\n{% highlight r %}\n# # # setup the inputs, class labels and model state\n# check out our data\nstr(iris)\n{% endhighlight %}\n\n\n\n{% highlight text %}\n## 'data.frame':\t150 obs. of  5 variables:\n##  $ Sepal.Length: num  5.1 4.9 4.7 4.6 5 5.4 4.6 5 4.4 4.9 ...\n##  $ Sepal.Width : num  3.5 3 3.2 3.1 3.6 3.9 3.4 3.4 2.9 3.1 ...\n##  $ Petal.Length: num  1.4 1.4 1.3 1.5 1.4 1.7 1.4 1.5 1.4 1.5 ...\n##  $ Petal.Width : num  0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.1 ...\n##  $ Species     : Factor w/ 3 levels \"setosa\",\"versicolor\",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n{% endhighlight %}\n\n\n\n{% highlight r %}\n# find the inputs minus the labels\nins \u003C- iris[,colnames(iris) != 'Species']\n\n# create a separate vector for the labels (labels must be numeric)\nlabs \u003C- as.numeric(iris[,'Species'])\n\n# get number of categories and features\nnfeats \u003C- dim(ins)[2]\nncats \u003C- length(unique(labs))\n\n# construct a state list\nst \u003C- list(learning_rate = 0.15, num_feats = nfeats, num_hids = 6, num_cats = ncats,\n  beta_val = 0, phi = 1, continuous = TRUE, in_wts = NULL, out_wts = NULL, wts_range = 1,\n  wts_center = 0, colskip = 4)\n{% endhighlight %}\n\nWe can then use `catleanr.suppls` to create our training matrix\n\n\n{% highlight r %}\n# tr_init initializes an empty training matrix\ntr \u003C- tr_init(nfeats, ncats)\n\n# tr_add fills in the data and procedure (i.e., training, test, model reset)\ntr \u003C- tr_add(inputs = ins, tr = tr, labels = labs, blocks = 12, ctrl = 0, \n  shuffle = TRUE, reset = TRUE)\n{% endhighlight %}\n\nHere's what our training matrix looks like after the setup procedure:\n\n{% highlight r %}\nhead(tr)\n{% endhighlight %}\n\n\n\n{% highlight text %}\n##      ctrl trial blk example  x1  x2  x3  x4 t1 t2 t3\n## [1,]    1     1   1     118 7.7 3.8 6.7 2.2 -1 -1  1\n## [2,]    0     2   1      64 6.1 2.9 4.7 1.4 -1  1 -1\n## [3,]    0     3   1      23 4.6 3.6 1.0 0.2  1 -1 -1\n## [4,]    0     4   1      87 6.7 3.1 4.7 1.5 -1  1 -1\n## [5,]    0     5   1      99 5.1 2.5 3.0 1.1 -1  1 -1\n## [6,]    0     6   1      92 6.1 3.0 4.6 1.4 -1  1 -1\n{% endhighlight %}\n\nFinally, we run the model with our state list `st` and training matrix `tr`\n\n\n{% highlight r %}\ndiva_model \u003C- slpDIVA(st, tr)\n{% endhighlight %}\n\nWe can examine performance of the model easily. \n\n\n{% highlight r %}\n# # # use response_probs to extract the response probabilities \n# # # for the target categories (for every training step (trial) \n# # # or averaged across blocks)\n\nresponse_probs(tr, diva_model$out, blocks = TRUE)\n{% endhighlight %}\n\n\n\n{% highlight text %}\n##  [1] 0.7852448 0.8431547 0.8103888 0.8067568 0.8087171 0.8102305 0.8135465\n##  [8] 0.8028162 0.8466575 0.8375568 0.8025279 0.8350697\n{% endhighlight %}\n\n`plot_training` is a simple function used to plot the learning of one or more models.\n\n\n{% highlight r %}\nplot_training(list(response_probs(tr, diva_model$out, blocks = TRUE)))\n{% endhighlight %}\n\n![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-9](/assets/rfigs/unnamed-chunk-9-1.svg)\n\nSo with no optimization, we can see that DIVA learns about as much as it is going to learn after one pass through our 150 item training set (obviously absent any cross-validation). Where does it go wrong? You might like to examine which items are not being correctly classified---you can do so by combining the classification probabilities with the original training matrix.\n\n\n{% highlight r %}\n# # # if we want to look at individual classication decisions, \n# # # we can do so by combining the model's output with the \n# # # original training matrix\n\ntrn_result \u003C- cbind(tr, round(diva_model$out, 4))\ntail(trn_result)\n{% endhighlight %}\n\n\n\n{% highlight text %}\n##         ctrl trial blk example  x1  x2  x3  x4 t1 t2 t3                     \n## [1795,]    0  1795  12     123 7.7 2.8 6.7 2.0 -1 -1  1 0.0005 0.0006 0.9989\n## [1796,]    0  1796  12      82 5.5 2.4 3.7 1.0 -1  1 -1 0.0000 0.9999 0.0000\n## [1797,]    0  1797  12     125 6.7 3.3 5.7 2.1 -1 -1  1 0.1204 0.1765 0.7030\n## [1798,]    0  1798  12       1 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2  1 -1 -1 1.0000 0.0000 0.0000\n## [1799,]    0  1799  12     144 6.8 3.2 5.9 2.3 -1 -1  1 0.0000 0.0000 1.0000\n## [1800,]    0  1800  12     129 6.4 2.8 5.6 2.1 -1 -1  1 0.0001 0.0002 0.9996\n{% endhighlight %}\n\nYou might also like to see how a number of initializations do on the problem. It's good practice to average over a series of initializations---something we did not do in this demonstration.\n\n\n{% highlight r %}\n# # # Run 5 models with the same params on the same training set\nmodel_inits \u003C- lapply(1:5, function(x) slpDIVA(st, tr))\n\n# # # determine the response probability for the correct class\nmodel_resp_probs \u003C- \n  lapply(model_inits, function(x) {\n    response_probs(tr, x$out, blocks = TRUE)})\n\n# # # plot the leanrning curves\nplot_training(model_resp_probs)\n{% endhighlight %}\n\n![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-11](/assets/rfigs/unnamed-chunk-11-1.svg)\n\nHere we see that there is a fair amount of variation across initializations. This suggests it would be smart to follow the typical procedure of averaging across a series of models to accurately represent the response probabilities. It also suggests that our approach would likely benefit from some optimization and validation. \n\n\nFuture demos will explore the tools within `catlearn.suppls` used to optimize hyper-parameters and examine the hidden unit representation space toward the goal of uncovering new insight about the problem.","src/content/blog/2017-6-28-catlearn-suppls-demo.md","a508bfb00130bb95",{"html":213,"metadata":214},"\u003Ch1 id=\"background\">background\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>This post is intended to help people get started with their own cognitive modelling or machine learning projects in the \u003Ccode>catlearn\u003C/code> environment with the help of \u003Ccode>catlearn.suppls\u003C/code>, the \u003Ca href=\"http://kurtzlab.psychology.binghamton.edu/\">Learning and Representation in Cognition Laboratory\u003C/a>’s suite of helper functions for modeling in \u003Ccode>catlearn\u003C/code>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The motivation behind \u003Ccode>catlearn.suppls\u003C/code> was to create a suite of functions that could be used to rapidly prototype new machine learning architectures that correspond to the cognitive modeling efforts of the LaRC Lab.

Hopefully you found this page because you were looking for a convenient and safe route to Binghamton University from anywhere in Binghamton \"proper\". \n\n*Some background.* This is the safest route I have found to get to Binghamton University assuming you're coming from the general vicinity of central Binghamton. After several years' experience biking in much larger cities, I was surprised to find that biking in Binghamton made me uncomfortable at times, and this route helped to alleviate much of that stress (at least for my daily commute). \n\nThere are a few modest climbs, but after a few trips you'll hardly even notice them! If you *really* want to get your blood pumping there are a few places you can take a left off of Moore to add a bit more climbing to the trip.\n\n*Note.* This route is most efficient if you are east of, say, Beethoven Street on Binghamton's west side. Even if you aren't you might prefer this route---especially in the winter when the bike lanes and sidewalks of the 201 bridge are not cleared of ice and debris (yea, like all winter). Happy Trails!\n\n*Update.* A fully-featured dedicated bike path [is in the works](http://www.pressconnects.com/story/news/local/2016/04/29/trail-blazing-16m-pedestrian-route-would-link-bu-downtown/82344124/) to link Binghamton University to downtown, so thank your government officials for addressing this problem. \n\n\u003Ciframe src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/embed?mid=1OkUodDDf2kCKFbrXyYXtxfb0aqUo_Cdr\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\">\u003C/iframe>\n\n\n\nStep-by-step directions:\n\n\u003Ctable style=\"width:100%\">\n  \u003Ctr>\n    \u003Cth>Direction\u003C/th>\n    \u003Cth>Distance\u003C/th> \n  \u003C/tr>\n  \u003Ctr>\n    \u003Ctd>Take the pedestrian bridge across the Susquehanna River\u003C/td>\n    \u003Ctd>\u003C/td> \n  \u003C/tr>\n  \n    \u003Ctr>\n    \u003Ctd>Turn right onto Pennsylvania Ave\u003C/td>\n    \u003Ctd>92 ft\u003C/td> \n  \u003C/tr>\n  \n    \u003Ctr>\n    \u003Ctd>Slight left to stay on Pennsylvania Ave\u003C/td>\n    \u003Ctd>0.694 mi\u003C/td> \n  \u003C/tr>\n  \n    \u003Ctr>\n    \u003Ctd>Turn right onto Moore Ave\u003C/td>\n    \u003Ctd>0.873 mi\u003C/td> \n  \u003C/tr>\n  \n    \u003Ctr>\n    \u003Ctd>Turn right onto Hazard Hill Rd\u003C/td>\n    \u003Ctd>262 ft\u003C/td> \n  \u003C/tr>\n  \n    \u003Ctr>\n    \u003Ctd>Continue onto Hawthorne Rd\u003C/td>\n    \u003Ctd>1,168 ft\u003C/td> \n  \u003C/tr>\n  \n    \u003Ctr>\n    \u003Ctd>Turn left onto Clifton Blvd\u003C/td>\n    \u003Ctd>0.925 mi\u003C/td> \n  \u003C/tr>\n  \n    \u003Ctr>\n    \u003Ctd>Turn left onto Clubhouse Rd\u003C/td>\n    \u003Ctd>0.413 mi\u003C/td> \n  \u003C/tr>\n  \n    \u003Ctr>\n    \u003Ctd>Turn left onto Country Club Rd\u003C/td>\n    \u003Ctd>0.314 mi\u003C/td> \n  \u003C/tr>\n  \n    \u003Ctr>\n    \u003Ctd>Turn right onto Washington Dr\u003C/td>\n    \u003Ctd>0.290 mi\u003C/td> \n  \u003C/tr>\n  \n    \u003Ctr>\n    \u003Ctd>Turn right onto Lehigh Ave\u003C/td>\n    \u003Ctd>341 ft\u003C/td> \n  \u003C/tr>\n  \n    \u003Ctr>\n    \u003Ctd>Continue onto E Access Rd til you're there!\u003C/td>\n    \u003Ctd>\u003C/td> \n  \u003C/tr>\n\n\u003C/table>","src/content/blog/2012-8-29-safest-route-to-bing.md","581e85995f01c8c4",{"html":468,"metadata":469},"\u003Cp>Hello!
