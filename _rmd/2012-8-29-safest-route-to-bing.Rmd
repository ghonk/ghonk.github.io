Hello! You somehow found this page so I'll assume you were looking for a convenient and safe route to Binghamton University from anywhere in Binghamton "proper". 

*Some background.* This is the safest route I have found to get to Binghamton University assuming you're coming from the general vicinity of central Binghamton. After several years' experience biking in much larger cities, I was surprised to find that biking in Binghamton made me uncomfortable at times, and this route helped to alleviate much of that stress (at least for my daily commute). There are a few modest climbs, but after a few trips you'll hardly even notice them!

Note that this route is only efficient if you are east of, say, Beethoven Street on Binghamton's west side. Even if you aren't you might prefer this route---especially in the winter when ice in the bike lanes and sidewalks on the 201 bridge is not cleared (yea, like all winter). Happy Trails!

*Update.* A fully-featured dedicated bike path [is in the works](http://www.pressconnects.com/story/news/local/2016/04/29/trail-blazing-16m-pedestrian-route-would-link-bu-downtown/82344124/) to link Binghamton University to downtown, so thank your government officials for addressing this problem.
